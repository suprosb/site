Thought I should write a good description of the content I have here on GitHub

I became fascinated by the IPTV / Web TV in year 2017
I could see so many Christian and family related streaming content and thought why not build an app to bring all together in a single place 

I got more interested with the development in HTML5 video content and the flexibility it offers to adapt to both iOS and Android platform and even PC playback 
Also with broadband Internet services and the smart television with bigger screen I saw that the best way would be to have it in HTML5 that can easily fit to any device 

I tried a few apps but they were either paid service or not suitable so had been looking for doing it on my own.

PlayerJS - Ever since I came to know this excellent html video player I started seeing the possibilities. By 2020 half of the streaming content I had had http protocol or incompatible format 
This began to change towards the end of 2020 and now almost every stream I have is playable
